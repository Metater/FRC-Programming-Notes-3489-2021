We chose the command robot template for our project.
There are functions that are called at different times when the robot is powered and connected,
each function is called at a time, some multiple times, and some once per event.
Some descriptions are copied from the Robot.java template code comments.

  This function is run when the robot is first started up and should be used for any initialization code.

  This function is called at around 50Hz, every 20ms for the duration of the robot being powered, don't put motor code in here
