If antijam doesn't work well, add a current ignore time


States should be used with a switch statement to simplify, even if could be done more efficiently,
ignore optimizations for independent actions for now




1. When intake is activated, extend and spin up roller,
  also spin the bottom intake belt(when nothing is on the sensor)

2. When the 1st ball hits that sensor, stop the bottom intake belt, and
trigger a ball index of the whole conveyor

3. Spin up bottom conveyor again

4. Repeat step 2 then 3 until 4 balls are in the robot

5. When the 5th ball hits the bottom sensor, stop the bottom belt, and toggle intake extension
